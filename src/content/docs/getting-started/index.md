Kuma is a powerful framework designed to generate scaffolds for any programming language, based on [Go templates](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template). It streamlines the process of setting up new projects by automating the creation of directories, files, and base code, ensuring consistency and saving valuable development time. Additionally, Kuma features a customizable TUI, providing an intuitive and efficient experience both for those creating scaffolds and those using them, making the process accessible and seamless for developers of all levels.
