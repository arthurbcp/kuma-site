description: Take your first steps with the Kuma Framework

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';


- Start an empty git repository

```bash
mkdir kuma-hello-world && cd kuma-hello-world && git init
```

- Add your first module with the Kuma CLI

```bash
kuma module add --repository kuma-framework/kuma-hello-world
```

- Follow the steps in your terminal until you see the message "Hello World!"

![hello](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf9c603f-1f58-4cde-ae9a-935bc6857f2f)


If you followed the previous steps correctly, you should have the following directory:
<FileTree>
- .kuma
    - kuma-hello-world
        - runs
            - hello-world-runs.yaml 
        - templates
           -  Main.go
        - base.yaml
    - kuma-modules.yaml
- go.mod
- main.go
- .gitmodules
</FileTree>

All Kuma files are located within the `.kuma` folder. Inside this folder, the organization is by modules (but you can also create runs that do not belong to any module).
The `kuma-hello-world` module is the first module you added to your project.
Within the module, you will find the following directories:

- `runs`: this directory contains the configuration files for runs, which are YAML files that define the process prior to applying the templates to generate the code. [Learn more](/overview/runs/)
- `templates`: this directory contains the template files that will be used to generate the code. [Learn more](/overview/templates/)

The `base.yaml` file is responsible for defining the directory and file structure that will be created in your project. [Learn more](/overview/builders/)

The `kuma-modules.yaml` file is the Kuma configuration file; it contains information about the modules you have added to your project and is automatically modified whenever a module is added or removed.

The `go.mod` and `main.go` files were generated by running the **initial** run.
